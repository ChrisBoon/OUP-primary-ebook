# Primary 'ebook' prototype
In early 2013 the UI team worked on a prototype for a more dynamic picture book style apps for iPad/tablets for young learners. The idea was to create a very bespoke, high quality interactive experience, but from a framework that would allow us to relatively easily create more titles.

The prototype was never completed due to internal factors.
